# Rails Server Config

> Configure your Ruby web server for maximum performance.

A little app to calculate the number of workers for your Ruby web server based on your app's RAM usage. Based on [Configuring Puma, Unicorn and Passenger for Maximum Efficiency](https://www.speedshop.co/2017/10/12/appserver.html). Created to give [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) a spin.
